# Nairobi Heatwave Impact Analysis
By Lavenda—Code & Coffee Queen!

## What’s This?
Explored Nairobi’s 2023-2024 heatwaves with ERA5 data and synthetic hospital admissions. Found 17 heatwaves, tweaked thresholds (29°C), and plotted a purple-red-green masterpiece!

## Files
- `synthetic_nairobi_health_2023_2024.csv`: My synthetic data—boosts at 1200, 1100!
- `heatwave_admissions.png`: My plot—temps, heatwaves, admissions!
- `nairobi_heatwave_analysis.py`: Full code—check it out!

## Skills
- `pandas`: Boosted data like a pro!
- `xarray`: Sliced Nairobi temps!
- `matplotlib`: Made it pretty!
